List of commands:

1) At the top of the template you will notice \documentclass{article}. A wide variety of classes have been implemented and are 
available online. A small list of some of the major ones are as follows: 

article - for articles in scientific journals, presentations, short reports, program documentation, etc...
IEEEtran - for articles with the IEEE Transactions format.
report - for longer reports containing several chapters, small books, thesis, etc...
book - for real books
slides - for slides.
letter - for writing letters.

2) In addition to the predefined formatting within a class, the user has the ability to define certain options specific to 
their document. Class option are to be inserted in between square brackets, [], before the curly braces, {}, that define 
the class to be used. Multiple options are to be separated by a comma.

\documentclass[option1,option2,......]{article}

We can define :
a.10pt, 11pt, 12pt - Sets the size of the main font in the document. [If no option is specified, 10pt is 
assumed.]

b.a4paper, letterpaper, etc... - Defines the paper size. The default size is letterpaper,a5paper, b5paper, executivepaper, 
and legalpaper can be specified.

c.fleqn[The full form of fleqn is "flush left equations"]-Typesets displayed formulas left-aligned instead of centered.
d.leqno[leqno stands for "left equation number"]-Places the numbering of formulas on the left hand side instead of the right.

e.titlepage, notitlepage - Specifies whether a new page should be started after the document title or not. The article class
does not start a new page by default, while report and book do.

f.onecolumn, twocolumn - Instructs LaTeX to typeset the document in one column or two columns.

g.twoside, oneside - Specifies whether double or single sided output should be generated. - oneside:Formats all pages with 
the same layout, typically for single-sided printing and twoside: Adjusts margins for odd (right) and even (left) pages, 
ideal for double-sided printing like in books.

h.landscape:-Changes the layout of the document to print in landscape mode.

i.openright, openany

j.draft
