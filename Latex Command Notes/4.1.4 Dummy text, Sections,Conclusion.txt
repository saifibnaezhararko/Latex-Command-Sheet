Dummy text

You may notice \lipsum[generates random text] is used to create random chunks of text. The number within the brackets indicates what specific 
dummy paragraph to use. There are 150 possible, so the maximum value allowed in the brackets is 150.



Sections

\section{section name} - This will help you to create sections in the template. We donâ€™t need to do anything to modify the 
text, it will automatically bold the text and number the sections (1, 2, 3 etc.).

\subsection{subsubsection name} - This will help you to create subsections. These headings will be one level down from the 
section headings and will be numbered like 1.1, 1.2.

\subsubsection{subsubsection name} - This will help you to create sections one level down from subsections. These heading 
will be numbered like 1.1.1, 1.1.2.

We can specify if you want sections to be not be numbered when using an asterisks * between the command name and the 
brackets section*{}.
The \paragraph{} command works similarly, but without numbering.


Equations

It can be very helpful to include a mathematical equation. To do so we need to use our handy \begin{equation} 
and \end{equation} functions to indicate the boundaries.
\begin{equation} x^{5n} +y^n=z^n \end{equation}
