how to bold font using \textbf{bold text}.

As we scroll down the template, we next see the \title{Your title here} command that we previously worked with when we 
modified the text within the brackets to change the title.

Then we see the \author command, which adds authors to the paper. These will be formatted in the way that is shown on the 
template. When you see \\ two backslashes, this indicates that the line is finished and a new one is to be made. For tables 
or formatting like the authors, it should work well, [but it is best to avoid using this for line breaks within the 
paragraphs that you might include in the paper.]

  \author{
   Ziyue Qi \\
   School of Coumputing and Information\\
   University of Pittsburgh\\
   Pittsburgh, PA 15213 \\
   \texttt{ziq2@pitt.edu} \\
   We also see another command \textttt{change the font to typewriter font} used within the \author{} command to change the 
   text to typewriter font.
   %% we can write command using percentage sign.

   \And allows for additional authors to be added. It must be used between each author listing.



The command \begin{document} enables us to format text for the body of the article. This command comes directly after the 
author section. It will be paired with \end{document} that you will see at the bottom of the template if you scroll down.

The \maketitle will add the title the page where the begin{document} command was used. If it is placed before 
begin{document}, the title and authors will show up on a separate page.

The abstract section can be distinguished using the begin{} and end{} functions just like we used for the body of the 
document. These two commands will also be used later to indicate that a specific part of the document has started or ended.
